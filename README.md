# Connecting-Global-Warming-and-Radiactive-Material
How underground nuclear weapons, buried radioactive waste and ordinace lost at sea heat up our planet.
The investigation of stored devices and those lost at sea create unbalanced heat sources which "bake" our planet.
Research into built up ambient heat from radiactive materials as a cause of ocean temperature increase. 
Low ambient temperatures of nuclear devices compound through mass production. 
Investigations into possible ground temperature increase in dump sites.
This project plans for salvaging and looking for weapons that have been lost or "off record".

Heat from nuclear waste is fed into fissures in earth's crust or released into coastal water.

Nuclear Waste and lost arrows are heat sources which we do not have the ability to turn off.

As heat is continuously released in our foreseable continuous future, the heat of our overal system "Earth" is going to rise.

Heat will become exponentially multiplied by tons of waste produced by munitions and nuclear power.
