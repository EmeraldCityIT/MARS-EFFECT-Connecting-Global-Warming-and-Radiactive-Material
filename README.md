# Connecting-Global-Warming-and-Radiactive-Material
Built up ambient heat from radiactive materials as cause of ocean temperature increase. Investigations into possible ground temperature increase in dump sites. How underground nuclear weapons, buried radioactive waste and lost ordinace heat up our planet. Low ambient temperatures of nuclear devices compounds through production. The investigation of stored devices and those lost at sea create unbalanced heat sources which "bake" our planet.
