# Connecting-Global-Warming-and-Radiactive-Material
How underground nuclear weapons, buried radioactive waste and ordinace lost at sea heat up our planet.
The investigation of stored devices and those lost at sea create unbalanced heat sources which "bake" our planet.
Research into built up ambient heat from radiactive materials as a cause of ocean temperature increase. 
Low ambient temperatures of nuclear devices compound through mass production. 
Investigations into possible ground temperature increase in dump sites.
Cleanup and looking for weapons that have been lost or "off record".
